Also: https://github.com/request/request
NOTE: It is DEPRECATED!

ALSO!!!  The original https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/ sit is no longer live.
I substitued a free catfacts api instead.  

IMPORTANT: Substitue "cat" for "movie" when reading the above to match the code in this repos!

You can find a number of free APIs at
