# CINF 301 Repository: Spring 2024
## Repository Name: cinf301-spr2024-class-examples
## Professor:  Daniel Plante

I'll post all class examples here on this repos.  You should clone it to directory on your system, but when modifying the code while practicing with it, you should copy that example to a different directory else you won't be able to _pull_ from the repos any longer.
